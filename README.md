# Web Application Vulnerability Assessment Report
# Executive Summary

BeanBliss entrusted TechArmor with a crucial mission: to conduct a Penetration Test â€“ Standard evaluation of their prized BeanBliss Buggy application. This assessment aimed to peel back the layers of the application's security from a standpoint of the unknown. It sought to unveil the application's resilience against the relentless barrage of common attack patterns while uncovering those hidden nooks and crannies, whether within its internal workings or exposed interfaces, that could potentially serve as gateways to trouble.

In the journey of this assessment, TechArmor unraveled 7 findings, each like a piece of a puzzle, slowly painting a picture of the application's security landscape. These findings are not just insights; they are windows into the world of cyber risk and protection, where every detail matters.

The findings are characterized as follows:
- **0 Critical Severity Findings**
- **6 High Severity Findings**
- **1 Medium Severity Finding**
- **0 Low Severity Findings**
- **0 Minimal Severity Findings**

# Observations

- **Reflective XSS**: User input lacks proper sanitization, enabling execution of malicious scripts within users' browsers, potentially leading to unauthorized data access and malicious actions.
- **Stored XSS**: Vulnerability allows permanent injection of malicious scripts into the application, posing a risk of widespread attacks like session hijacking and data theft.
- **SQL Injection**: Identified vulnerability that may result in unauthorized database access and manipulation, posing a serious threat to data integrity and confidentiality.
- **Weak Password Hashing**: Storage of passwords using weak hashing algorithms, risking unauthorized access and potential data breaches.
- **File Upload Vulnerability**: Presence of a file upload vulnerability could lead to remote code execution and data breaches, significantly compromising system security.
- **Reverse Shell**: Detection of a reverse shell indicates a potential security breach due to remote code execution via file uploads.
- **Server-side Input Validation**: Absence of adequate server-side input validation, especially in the rating system, allows submission of ratings beyond the intended limit, compromising data accuracy and system integrity.
- **Hidden Directories**: Identification of unprotected or undisclosed directories containing sensitive information, posing a risk as they're publicly accessible.

# Recommendations

1. **Server-side Input Validation**: Prioritize fixing this vulnerability as it's exploitable by attackers to inject malicious code.
2. **Critical Vulnerabilities First**: Address critical vulnerabilities like weak password hashing promptly.
3. **Keep Software Updated**: Regularly update the application with the latest security patches to mitigate known vulnerabilities.
4. **Security Awareness Training**: Implement a security awareness program to educate employees about common security threats and how to mitigate them.
